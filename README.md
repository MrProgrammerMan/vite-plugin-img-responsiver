# img-responsiver

*NOTE*: This tool generates image files, folders and modifies markup files.
It creates and also deletes files.
Use it as intended and described.

*ALSO NOTE*: **This tool was made by a newbie software engineering student messing around. It will not be updated or fixed, and frankly is just a silly solution to a problem that's already been solved. Please don't use it.**

`img-responsiver` is a Vite plugin that generates images at different sizes and file formats, replacing HTML `<img>` tags with `<picture>` tags for responsiveness. This ensures that your web application serves the most appropriate image for the user's device, improving load times and user experience.

The plugin utilizes the `configResolved` Vite hook (hence why this is not a Rollup plugin).

## Features

- Automatically generates responsive images in multiple sizes and formats.
- Replaces `<img>` tags with `<picture>` tags in your HTML.
- Supports various image formats including JPEG, PNG, and WebP.

## Who this tool is for

This tool allows automatically generating responsive images for static websites.
It's designed to improve responsiveness of a web project with minimal setup and effort from the developer.
It offloads the tedious task of manually generating responsive images.

## Who this tool is NOT for

This tool performs a function usually handled by content delivery networks(CDNs) in larger deployed projects.
If you are developing such a system, this tool should not replace that functionality.
Some web development frameworks also perform a similar task, so this tool may not be suitable if you are using one of those. Its just designed to bring responsive images to static sites where one might not typically bother.

## Installation

To install the plugin, add it to your project using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install vite-plugin-img-responsiver --save-dev
# or
yarn add vite-plugin-img-responsiver --dev
```

## Configuration
To customize img-responsiver for your project, you can pass a configuration object with various options.
*All fields are optional*, and default values will be used if fields are not specified.

### Example configuration
Here is an example configuration with descriptions of each available option:
```javascript
import imgResponsiver from 'vite-plugin-img-responsiver';

export default {
  imagesDirs: './src/assets/images', // Specifies one or more directories for source images
  imageExtensions: ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.webp', '.svg'], // File types to process
  conversionSizes: [320, 480, 768, 1024, 1280], // Target sizes in pixels for responsive images
  outputFileTypes: ['.webp', '.jpeg', '.png'], // Output formats in priority order
  outputDir: './dist/images', // Directory for saving generated images
  htmlDirs: './src', // Specifies directories containing HTML files to process
  htmlFileType: '.html', // Extension of HTML files
  imgTagRegex: /<img[^>]*src=["'][^"']+["'][^>]*>/g // Regex to match <img> tags for replacement
};
```

### Configuration options
- `imagesDirs`: Specifies one or more directories containing source images. Can be a string or an array.
- `imageExtensions`: Array of image file extensions to process. Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.avif`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, and `.svg`.
- `conversionSizes`: Array of target dimensions in pixels. Images are resized proportionally, with the largest dimension scaled to match each specified size.
- `outputFileTypes`: Array of output file formats in priority order. Use this to specify preferred image formats for different browsers.
- `outputDir`: Directory where generated responsive images will be saved.
- `htmlDirs`: Specifies directories with HTML files to process. Can be a string or an array.
- `htmlFileType`: File extension for HTML files, e.g., `.html`.
- `imgTagRegex`: Regular expression to match `<img>` tags for replacement. The default regex targets common HTML `<img>` tags.

Clone the repo and run the example folder as a vite project:

It works both in dev and in preview!

## Feedback
This is the first time I have created a Vite plugin, or any plugin for that matter.
It has been a learning experience, and I am very pleased to have an actually working plugin.
I have done my best to make this plugin functional, easy to use adn bug-free. Even so, I have no doubt there are problems with it and there are certainly things that are not standard or not standardized. You are more than welcome to submit a pull request or contact me with any suggestions or questions!
